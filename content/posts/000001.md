# ä¸€ Begin the Begin

After all everyone needs a little R.E.M. to make dreams happen.

So opens what may in retrospect be a new chapter. Fingers crossed. Self chastised for superstition.

## Check. Check one, two.

Coffee? Check.

Music? Check.

LLM? Check.

Chuck? Check.

Sipping coffee. Listening to WKEXP. Staring at a prompt window. Instructional video from Network Chuck queued. Time to make a blog.

Don't get it twisted: the generative AI is just for brain-storming. For the most part, this will be a locally-sourced, human-brain to blog-table enterprise. Minimally cybernetically enhanced. More bionic, less borg.

Frankly, I wouldn't use the LLM for this project at all, but over the course of my life I have found that what rings pleasantly in my ears tends not to have mass-appeal. Not that I am expecting any sort of sizeable audience, but, you know, somebody in the house to attend the performance would be nice. Thus the Large Language Model branding assistant.

Perhaps I just want to be able to blame HAL/Jarvis/Deep Thought if this goes poorly. Which reminds me: Towel? Check.

Next entry should be on GitHub. Time to git gud. ;)
